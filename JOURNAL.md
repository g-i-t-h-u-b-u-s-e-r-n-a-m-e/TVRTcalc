## 10/4/2025 - Planning/research for parts  

Here's the stuff I think I'll need for the calculator:

- Mobile chipset: probably MediaTek MT6580, very slow phone processor but will be more than good enough for a calculator. Also, only 15 bucks. Image:

- Screen: a standard AliExpress 2.8in-3.5in display will work. Image:

- Battery: just going to salvage something from my phone collection
- Keyboard: I'll need to make a PCB for that
- Case & buttons: 3d printable
- Software: Android custom ROM I'll make!
