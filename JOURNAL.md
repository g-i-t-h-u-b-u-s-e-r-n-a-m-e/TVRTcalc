## 10/4/2025 - Planning/research for parts  

Here's the stuff I think I'll need for the calculator:

- Mobile chipset: probably MediaTek MT6580, very slow phone processor but will be more than good enough for a calculator. Also, only 15 bucks. Image:

- Screen: a standard AliExpress 2.8in-3.5in display will work. Image:

- Battery: just going to salvage something from my phone collection
- Keyboard: I'll need to make a PCB for that
- Case & buttons: 3d printable
- Software: Android custom ROM I'll make!

  

## 10/15/2025 - Designing the keyboard & suffering with PCBs  

First, I followed along with the Hackpad tutorial to learn how to make a keyboard in KiCAD. Then, I realised the keys with that would be way too big for a calculator keypad so I started over. I discovered the Tanmatsu project already had a keyboard that could be easily modified to suit my needs, so I modified that into something that'd work. Then I realised I had COMPLETELY no idea what I was doing and started over following a tutorial from YouTube while using my KiCAD disaster as a reference. I also switched from KiCAD to EasyEDA because KiCAD just didn't click with me (KiCAD is the LMMS of PCB design, and I'm more of an Audiotool guy). Then I realised the tutorial sucked so I switched to a better one. After that I designed the schematic & PCB in a way that'll probably work.
